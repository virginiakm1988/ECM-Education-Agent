# ECM Education Agent - Deployment Guide

## 🎉 Your project has been successfully pushed to GitHub!

**Repository URL**: https://github.com/virginiakm1988/ECM-Education-Agent

## 📋 Next Steps to Enable GitHub Pages

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/virginiakm1988/ECM-Education-Agent
2. **Click on "Settings"** tab (top navigation)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. **Under "Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. **Save the settings**

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is already configured and will:
- ✅ Automatically trigger on pushes to `main` branch
- ✅ Install Node.js dependencies
- ✅ Build the React application
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages

### 3. Your Live Website

Once GitHub Actions completes (usually 2-5 minutes), your ECM Education Agent will be live at:

**🌐 https://virginiakm1988.github.io/ECM-Education-Agent**

## 🚀 What's Included

### React UI Features
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Overview with feature cards and statistics
- ✅ **ECM Explanation**: Personalized explanations by research field
- ✅ **Development Guide**: Repository analysis and suggestions
- ✅ **Repository Analysis**: Upload and analyze code repositories
- ✅ **Script Reorganization**: Reorganize fragmented scripts
- ✅ **Templates**: Generate ECM-compliant project templates
- ✅ **Chat Interface**: Interactive chat with the ECM agent
- ✅ **Settings**: API configuration and preferences

### Python Backend Features
- ✅ **NVIDIA NIM Integration**: Multiple model support
- ✅ **ECM Knowledge Base**: Comprehensive emergency management knowledge
- ✅ **Vector Database**: Semantic search capabilities
- ✅ **FastAPI Backend**: RESTful API endpoints
- ✅ **Streamlit Interface**: Alternative web interface

## 🔧 Running Locally

### React Frontend
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Python Backend
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run FastAPI server
uvicorn api_server:app --reload --port 8000

# Or run Streamlit interface
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## 🔑 API Configuration

### Required API Keys

1. **NVIDIA API Key**
   - Get from: https://ngc.nvidia.com/
   - Used for: NVIDIA NIM model access

2. **OpenAI API Key**
   - Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Used for: Embeddings and fallback models

### Setting Up API Keys

#### For Local Development:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_nvidia_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

#### For GitHub Pages (Frontend Only):
The React app includes fallback demo responses, so it works without backend API keys for demonstration purposes.

#### For Full Backend Integration:
1. Deploy your Python backend to a cloud service (Heroku, Railway, etc.)
2. Update the API endpoint in the React app settings
3. Configure environment variables on your hosting platform

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

The React UI is fully responsive and works on:
- ✅ Desktop computers
- ✅ Tablets
- ✅ Mobile phones
- ✅ All modern browsers

## 🎨 Customization

### Branding
- Update colors in `tailwind.config.js`
- Modify logo and branding in `src/components/Layout.js`
- Change app name in `package.json` and `public/index.html`

### Features
- Add new pages in `src/pages/`
- Update navigation in `src/components/Layout.js`
- Modify API endpoints in individual page components

## 🔄 Updates and Maintenance

### To Update Your Deployed Site:
1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your update message"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. GitHub Actions will automatically redeploy

### Monitoring Deployment:
- Check the **"Actions"** tab in your GitHub repository
- View build logs and deployment status
- Get notified of any deployment failures

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **404 Error on GitHub Pages**
   - Ensure repository name matches the homepage URL in package.json
   - Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

2. **Blank Page After Deployment**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify the basename in App.js matches your repository name

3. **GitHub Actions Failing**
   - Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json

4. **API Connection Issues**
   - The frontend includes demo responses for offline functionality
   - For full backend integration, deploy the Python backend separately

### Getting Help:
- Check GitHub Actions logs in the "Actions" tab
- Review browser console for frontend errors
- Ensure all file paths are correct

## 🎯 Production Deployment Options

### Frontend Only (Current Setup):
- ✅ GitHub Pages (Free)
- ✅ Netlify
- ✅ Vercel
- ✅ AWS S3 + CloudFront

### Full Stack Deployment:
- **Backend**: Railway, Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud
- **Frontend**: Same as above, configured to connect to backend API

## 📊 Analytics and Monitoring

### Optional Additions:
- Google Analytics for usage tracking
- Error monitoring with Sentry
- Performance monitoring with Web Vitals

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- ✅ API keys are not exposed in frontend code
- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ HTTPS enabled by default on GitHub Pages
- ✅ Content Security Policy headers

## 📈 Performance Optimization

- ✅ Code splitting with React Router
- ✅ Lazy loading of components
- ✅ Optimized build process
- ✅ Compressed assets
- ✅ CDN delivery via GitHub Pages
